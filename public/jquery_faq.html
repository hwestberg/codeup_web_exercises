The 163-year-old stronghold of Fort Jefferson was once used to house prisoners during the Civil War, and a 17th century Spanish galleon was uncovered by divers in 1989.</dd>

				<li>Badlands National Park contains numerous fossils of extinct creatures, largely from the Oligocene era of about 30 million years ago. The period was dominated by mammals such as prehistoric camels and rhinoceroses, specimens of which have been uncovered in the park;</li>
